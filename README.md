Use the file *generate.py* to complete your ratings table. 
It takes in argument *--name* the name of the files you want to use and it saves the complete matrix as *output.npy*.

Among the good pratice of datascience, we encourage you to use conda or virtualenv to create python environment. 
To test your code on our platform, you are required to update the *requirements.txt*, with the different librairies you might use.

  > pip install -r requirements.txt
